# coluars
A module for customizing terminal output in Lua using ANSI escape codes.
This module is implemented completely in Lua and has no dependancies other than the Lua programming language and its standard libraries. It is made to be cloned directly into your project files and not to be distributed via a package manager since I disapprove of any dependancies outside of the standard libraries and ANSI standard.
Check the example file to learn how to use this module.
